// Student Assessments. All assessments are normalized between 0 and 1, rounded to 2 decimal places (0 being poor and 1 being excellent). If a student doesn't have a certain assessment, then that assessment value is -1.0. Note that percussionists have a different set of assessments than other performers, but everyone plays the chromatic scale. Each line represents assessments for a particular segment. Assessments are ordered as follows: Lyrical_Etude: Musicality_Tempo_Style Tone_Quality Note_Accuracy Rhythmic_Accuracy Artistry.
