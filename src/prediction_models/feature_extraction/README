Feature Extraction

Feature extraction code goes here. This should include:
-a different function for each feature to extract (mfcc's count as a single 
 feature even though there are 13 results)
-for a specific experiment, you might want a function that extracts all the
 features you need and concatenates them into the final feature vector.

The returned feature vectors should be of size(1, num_features). This makes
them compatible with the format of training data in libsvm, where each row 
corresponds to a data point, and columns correspond to features. 

Each feature extraction function should extract features over a single window.
Aggregation is a task left to the user, although we might want to include 
standard aggregation functions (mean, standard deviation) here as well.
