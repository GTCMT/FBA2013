Scanning

Code here reads audio files from the FBA database into vectors. This could be
split into two functions:
-get the audio file names and corresponding labels
-from the audio filenames, read in audio.

Options we should support include:
-which band(s)
-which instrument(s)
-which segment(s)
-which assessment label(s)
